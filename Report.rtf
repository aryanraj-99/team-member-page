\pard{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf2\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li720\sl240\slmult1 Layout Alignment: Aligning the layout of team member cards on different screen sizes was a significant challenge. Despite numerous attempts, achieving consistent alignment across various devices remained elusive.\par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}\par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Content Organization: Arranging the content within each team member card proved to be more challenging than anticipated. Balancing the inclusion of necessary information while maintaining visual appeal was a delicate task.\par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}\par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Responsive Design: Ensuring the responsiveness of the page across different devices posed a considerable hurdle. Despite implementing media queries and flexible layout techniques, some elements still did not adapt seamlessly to varying screen sizes.\b\par
